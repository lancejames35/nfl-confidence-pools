# Security Audit and Improvements

## Current Security Status: GOOD ✅

### ✅ Security Features Already Implemented

1. **Password Security**
   - bcrypt with 12 salt rounds (secure)
   - Password validation in User model

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Session-based authentication
   - JWT token backup authentication
   - Role-based access control (commissioner, member)
   - League membership verification
   - Pick deadline enforcement

3. **Security Headers**
   - Helmet.js implemented with CSP
   - CORS properly configured
   - XSS protection enabled

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - Comprehensive rate limiting for all endpoints
   - Different limits for different operations
   - WebSocket rate limiting implemented
   - User-based and IP-based limiting

5. **Input Validation**
   - express-validator used in routes
   - SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries
   - Integer parsing for parameters

6. **Data Protection**
   - Password fields removed from user objects
   - Sensitive data filtering in auth middleware

## Security Improvements Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling

**Issue**: Error messages could potentially leak sensitive information
**Solution**: Implement generic error responses for production

### 2. Session Security Enhancement

**Issue**: Session configuration could be more secure
**Solution**: Added secure session configuration

### 3. Request Size Limits

**Issue**: No protection against large payload attacks
**Solution**: Added request size limits

### 4. Additional Security Headers

**Issue**: Could benefit from additional security headers
**Solution**: Enhanced helmet configuration

## Files Modified

1. `app.js` - Enhanced security middleware
2. `middleware/auth.js` - Improved error handling
3. `config/security.js` - New security configuration

## Recommendations for Production

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Ensure all secrets are in environment variables
   - Use strong JWT secrets (64+ characters)
   - Set secure database credentials

2. **HTTPS Only**
   - Enable `secure: true` for cookies in production
   - Force HTTPS redirects

3. **Database Security**
   - Use least-privilege database users
   - Regular security updates
   - Database connection encryption

4. **Monitoring**
   - Log security events
   - Monitor for suspicious patterns
   - Set up alerts for rate limit violations

5. **Regular Updates**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Run security audits (`npm audit`)
   - Monitor for new vulnerabilities

## Security Score: A- (Excellent)

The application has excellent security practices implemented. Only minor enhancements were needed.
